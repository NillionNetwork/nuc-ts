/**
 * Compatibility bridge between @bufbuild/protobuf (used by our library) and protobuf.js (used by CosmJS).
 *
 * This file exists solely to handle the incompatibility between two protobuf implementations:
 * - Our library uses the modern @bufbuild/protobuf package
 * - CosmJS still depends on the older protobuf.js package
 *
 * This wrapper maintains API compatibility with the cosmjs library while using `@bufbuild/protobuf`.
 * It bridges the gap between different protobuf implementations during the migration from
 * protobufjs to `@bufbuild/protobuf` and from the cluster's migration from libp2p to gRPC.
 *
 * Only `encode` and `fromPartial` methods are implemented as they are sufficient for sending transactions.
 *
 * We use `@ts-expect-error` because `TsProtoGeneratedType` expects `protobuf.Writer/Reader`,
 * but we're using `BinaryWriter/Reader`. The methods used are compatible between these types,
 * allowing us to bypass the type check safely in this context.
 *
 * TODO: This entire file can be removed once CosmJS updates to @bufbuild/protobuf or provides
 * a compatibility layer. Track progress at: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/issues
